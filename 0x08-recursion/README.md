# C - Recursion
This repository contains a collection of C programs that utilize recursion to perform various operations on strings and numbers. Each program serves a specific purpose and demonstrates the concept of recursion. Below is a brief description of each program:

## 0-puts_recursion.c
This program defines a function that prints a given string, followed by a new line, using recursion.

## 1-print_rev_recursion.c
In this program, you will find a function that prints a given string in reverse order using recursion.

## 2-strlen_recursion.c
The function implemented in this program calculates and returns the length of a given string using recursion.

## 3-factorial.c
This program includes a function that calculates and returns the factorial of a given number using recursion.

## 4-pow_recursion.c
The program contains a function that calculates and returns the value of x raised to the power of y using recursion.

## 5-sqrt_recursion.c
A function is provided in this program that calculates and returns the natural square root of a number using recursion.

## 6-is_prime_number.c
In this program, you will find a function that determines whether a given input integer is a prime number. It returns 1 if the number is prime and 0 if it is not, using recursion.

## 100-is_palindrome.c
This program defines a function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. It returns 1 if the string is a palindrome and 0 if it is not, using recursion.

## 101-wildcmp.c
The program includes a function that compares two strings and determines if they can be considered identical. It returns 1 if the strings are identical and 0 if they are not, using recursion.

Feel free to explore these programs to understand and learn more about recursion in the C programming language.
