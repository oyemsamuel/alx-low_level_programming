# C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings
This repository contains a collection of C programs that focus on pointers, arrays, and strings. Each program serves a specific purpose and demonstrates different concepts related to these topics. Below is a brief description of each program:

## 0-reset_to_98.c
This program defines a function that takes a pointer to an integer as a parameter and updates the value it points to with the value 98.

## 1-swap.c
In this program, you will find a function that swaps the values of two integers.

## 2-strlen.c
The function implemented in this program calculates and returns the length of a given string.

## 3-puts.c
A function is provided in this program that prints a string, followed by a new line, to the standard output.

## 4-print_rev.c
This program includes a function that prints a given string in reverse order, followed by a new line.

## 5-rev_string.c
The function implemented here reverses a given string.

## 6-puts2.c
A function is defined in this program that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

## 7-puts_half.c
In this program, you will find a function that prints half of a given string, followed by a new line.

## 8-print_array.c
The program includes a function that prints a specified number of elements from an integer array, followed by a new line.

## 9-strcpy.c
This program defines a function that copies the content of a source string, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the destination buffer.

## 100-atoi.c
A function is provided in this program that converts a string to an integer.

## 101-keygen.c
This program is designed to generate random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.
