# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
## 0-positive_or_negative.c
This program generates a random number and assigns it to the variable 'n' each time it runs. The objective is to complete the code so that it prints whether the number stored in 'n' is positive or negative.
## 1-last_digit.c
This program generates a random number and assigns it to the variable 'n' each time it is executed. The task is to complete the code to print the last digit of the number stored in 'n'.
## 2-print_alphabet.c
This program prints the lowercase alphabet in order, followed by a new line.
## 3-print_alphabets.c
This program prints the lowercase alphabet in order, and then the uppercase alphabet, followed by a new line.
## 4-print_alphabt.c
This program prints the lowercase alphabet in order, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', followed by a new line.
## 5-print_numbers.c
This program prints all the single-digit numbers in base 10, starting from 0 and ending with 9, followed by a new line.
## 6-print_numberz.c
This program prints all the single-digit numbers in base 10, starting from 0 and ending with 9, followed by a new line.
## 7-print_tebahpla.c
This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order, starting from 'z' and ending with 'a', followed by a new line.
## 8-print_base16.c
This program prints all the numbers in base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase, starting from 0 and ending with 'f', followed by a new line.
## 9-print_comb.c
This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by commas and spaces.
## 100-print_comb3.c
This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits, separated by commas and spaces.
## 101-print_comb4.c
This program prints all possible different combinations of three digits, separated by commas and spaces.
## 102-print_comb5.c
This program prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers, separated by commas and spaces.
